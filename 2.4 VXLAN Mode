Step 1 Change modes.
Run the following command to change the network modes of pool1 and pool2. Change
the value of ipipMode to Never and that of vxlanMode to Always. Manually add the
vxlanMode field of pool2.
[root@k8smaster1 network]# kubectl edit ippool

Step 2 View NIC information.
Run the following command and view the NIC information:
[root@k8smaster1 network]# ip add
The vxlan.calico information is generated in the NIC.

Step 3 View route information.
Run the following command and verify that the egress of the pool1 and pool2 network
segments is vxlan.calico:
[root@k8smaster1 network]# route -n

Step 4 Test network connectivity.
view pods
kubectl get pods -o wide


Log in to a pod and ping pods in different network segments of different nodes.
kbectl exec -it ippoll-podi sh

Delete the test pods.
[root@k8smaster1 network]# calicoctl delete -f pool1.yaml
[root@k8smaster1 network]# kubectl delete -f pool2.yaml
